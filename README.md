# LeafletImageMapper
Generate image hotspot or imagemap html with leaflet in pure javascript.  Vuejs is use for ease of templating in demo: https://niiknow.github.io/limapper/

So you have an image and you want to map hotspot on the image relative to its pixel coordinates.  LeafletImageMapper can output in both JSON and/or imagemap html.  

You can use tools like Vuejs to render imagemap to the UI and/or (ImageMapster)[https://github.com/jamietre/ImageMapster] to provide user friendly interaction.
